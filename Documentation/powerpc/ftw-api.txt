Virtual Accelerator Switchboard and Fast Thread-Wakeup API

    Power9 processor supports a hardware subystem known as the Virtual
    Accelerator Switchboard (VAS) which allows two entities in the Power9
    system to efficiently exchange messages. Messages must be formatted as
    Coprocessor Reqeust Blocks (CRB) and be submitted using the COPY/PASTE
    instructions (new in Power9).

    Usage of VAS depends on the entities exchanging the messages and
    currently two usages have been identified.

    First usage of VAS, referred to as VAS/NX involves a software thread
    submitting data compression requests to a co-processor (hardware/nest
    accelerator) aka NX engine. The API for this usage is described in the
    VAS/NX API document.

    Alternatively, VAS can be used by two software threads to efficiently
    exchange messages. Initially, this mechanism is intended to wake up a
    waiting thread quickly - i.e "fast thread wake-up (FTW)". This document
    describes the user API for this VAS/FTW mechanism.

    Application access to the FTW mechanism is provided through the NX-FTW
    device node (/dev/crypto/nx-ftw) implemented by the VAS/FTW device
    driver.

    A multi-threaded software processes that intends to use the Fast-thread
    wake up mechanism must first setup a channel (consisting of a pair of
    VAS windows) for the waiting and waking threads to communicate.
    The channel is set up by opening the NX-FTW device and issuing the
    VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl. Upon successful return from the ioctl, the waiting
    side of channel is complete and a thread can issue the "Wait" instruction
    to wait for an event.

    After the successful return from the VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl, the waking
    thread must use mmap() system call on the same file descriptor and
    obtain a pointer to a virtual address known as the "paste address".
    Once the mmap() call succeeds the setup of "waking" side of the channel
    is complete. To wake up a waiting thread, the waking thread should use
    the "COPY" and "PASTE" instructions to write a zero-filled CRB to the
    paste-address.

    The wait and wake up operations can be repeated as long as the paste
    address and the NX-FTW file descriptor are valid (i.e until munmap()
    of the paste address or a close() of the NX-FTW fd).

1. NX-FTW Device Node

    There is one /dev/crypto/nx-ftw node in the system and it provides
    access to the VAS/FTW functionality.

    The only valid operations (system calls) on the NX-FTW node are:

        - open() the device for read and write.

        - issue the VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl to set up a channel.

	- mmap() the file descriptor

        - close the device node.

    Other file operations on the NX-FTW node are undefined.

    Note that the COPY and PASTE operations go directly to the hardware
    and do not involve system calls or go through the NX-FTW device.

    Although a system may have several instances of the VAS in the system
    (typically, one per P9 chip) there is just one NX-FTW device node in
    the system.

    When the NX-FTW device node is opened, the kernel assigns a suitable
    instance of VAS to the process. Kernel will make a best-effort attempt
    to assign an optimal instance of VAS for the process - based on the CPU/
    chip that the process is running on. In the initial release, the kernel
    does not support migrating the VAS instance if the process migrates from
    a CPU on one chip to a CPU on another chip.

    Applications may chose a specific instance of the VAS using the 'vas_id'
    field in the VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl as detailed below.

2. Open NX-FTW node

    The device should be opened for read and write. No special privileges
    are needed to open the device. The device may be opened multiple times.

    Each open() of the NX-FTW device is associated with one channel of
    communication. There is a system-wide limit (currently 64K windows per
    chip and since some are reserved for hardware, there are about 32K
    channels per chip). If no more channels are available, the open() system
    call will fail.

    See open(2) system call man pages for other details such as return
    values, error codes and restrictions.

3. Setup a communication channel (VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl)

    A process that intends to use the Fast Thread-wakeup mechanism must
    first setup a channel by issuing the VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl.

        #include <asm/nx-ftw.h>

        struct vas_ftw_setup_attr ftwattr;

        rc = ioctl(fd, VAS_FTW_SETUP, &ftwattr);

    The attributes of ftwattr are as follows:

        struct vas_ftw_setup_attr {
                int16_t       version;
                int16_t       vas_id;
                uint32_t      reserved;

                int64_t       reserved1;
		int64_t       flags;
                int64_t       reserved2;
        };

    The version field identifies the version of the API and must currently
    be set to 1.

    The vas_id field identifies a specific instance of the VAS that the
    application wishes to access. See section on VAS ID below.

    The reserved fields must all be set to zeroes.

    The flags field specifies additional attributes to the channel. The
    only valid bit in the flags for Fast thread-wakeup usage are:

        VAS_FLAGS_PIN_WINDOW    if set, indicates that the channel should be
                                pinned in cache. This flag is restricted
                                to privileged users. See Pinning windows
                                below.

    All the other bits in the flags field must be set to 0.

    Return value:

    The VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl returns 0 on success. On error, it returns -1
    and sets the errno variable to indicate the error.

    Error codes:

        EINVAL      version is invalid

        EINVAL      vas_id is invalid

        EINVAL      fd does not refer to a valid VAS device.

        ENOSPC      System has too many active channels (windows) open,

        EPERM       VAS_FLAGS_PIN_WINDOW is set in 'flags' field and process
                    is not privileged.

        EINVAL      reserved fields are not set to 0.

    See the ioctl(2) man page for more details, error codes and restrictions.

4. mmap() NX-FTW device fd

    The mmap() system call for a NX-FTW device fd returns a "paste address"
    that the application can use to COPY/PASTE a CRB to the waiting thread.

        paste_addr = mmap(NULL, size, prot, flags, fd, offset);

    Only restrictions on mmap for a NX-FTW device fd are:

        - size parameter should be one page size

        - offset parameter should be 0ULL.

    Refer to mmap(2) man page for additional details/restrictions.

    In addition to the error conditions listed on the mmap(2) man page,
    mmap() can also fail with one of following error codes:

        EINVAL      fd is not associated with an open channel (window)
		    (i.e mmap() does not follow a successful call to the
		    VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl).

        EINVAL      offset field is not 0ULL.


5. VAS ID

    A system may have several instances of VAS in the hardware, typically
    one per POWER 9 chip. The choice of a specific instance of VAS can have
    significant impact on the performance, specially if the application
    migrates from one CPU to another. Applications can specify a vas_id
    using the VAS_FTW_SETUP ioctl and should be prudent in choosing an
    instance of VAS.

    The vas_id for each instance of VAS is listed as the device tree
    property 'ibm,vas-id'. Determining the specific vas_id to use for
    a specific application thread is beyond the scope of this API.

    If the application has no preference, the vas_id field may be set to
    -1 and the kernel will choose a suitable instance of the VAS engine.

6. COPY/PASTE operations:

    Applications should use the COPY and PASTE instructions defined in
    the RFC to copy/paste the CRB. For VAS/FTW usage, the contents of
    CRB, are ignored and can be zero, but CRB should point to a valid buffer 

7. Interrupt completion and signal handling

    No VAS-specific signals will be generated to the application threads
    with the VAS/FTW usage.


8. Example/Proposed usage of the VAS/FTW API

    In the following example we use two threads that use the VAS/FTW API.
    Thread T1 sets up the channel and uses the WAIT instruction to wait for
    an event. Thread T2 uses copy/paste instructions to wake up T1.
    Note that the pthread_cond_wait() calls must be in a loop for spurious
    wake ups, but are simplified here.

    Common interfaces:

        static bool paste_done;

        #define WAIT    .long (0x7C00003C)

        static inline int do_wait(void)
        {
                __asm__ __volatile(stringify_in_c(WAIT)";");
        }

        /*
         * Check if paste_done is true
         */
        static bool is_paste_done(void)
        {
                return __sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&paste_done, 1, 0);

        }

        /*
         * Set paste_done to true
         */
        static inline void set_paste_done(void)
        {
                __sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&paste_done, 0, 1);
        }


        int fd = -1;	// global, visible to both T1 and T2

    Thread T1:

        struct vas_ftw_setup_attr ftwattr;

        fd = open("/dev/crypto/nx-ftw", O_RDWR);

        memset(&rxattr, 0, sizeof(rxattr));
        ftwattr.version = 1;
	ftwattr.vas_id = -1;

        rc = ioctl(fd, VAS_FTW_SETUP, &ftwattr);

        /* Tell T2 that waiter side of channel is ready */
        pthread_cond_signal(&rx_win_ready);

        /* Rx set up done */

        /* later, wait for an event to occur */

        while(!is_paste_done())
            do_wait();

    Thread T2:

        /* Wait for waiter side of channel to be set up first */
        pthread_cond_wait(&rx_win_ready);

        prot = PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE;
        paste_addr = mmap(NULL, 4096, prot, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0ULL);

        /* Tx setup done */

        /* later ... */

        set_paste_done();           /* ... event occured */
        write_empty_crb(paste_addr); /* wake up T1 */
